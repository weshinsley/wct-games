# TD_KEY

By Tom Doel, Sometime in 1995 or 1996. Apparently, Wes added a timer handler at some point.

This library handled all our key-on key-off routines in a better way than
Pascal was able to do on its own.

## Compiling

* In DosBox...
* File, Change directory to `LIBS/TD_KEY/SRC`
* Options, Open `TD_KEY.TP`
* File, Open `TD_KEY.PAS`, and compile with ALT+F9.
