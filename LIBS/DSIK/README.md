# DSIK (Digital Sound Interface Kit)

(C) 1994 Carlos Hasan

## Compiling

I needed to recompile `LOAD.PAS`, as I think the TPUs compiled with the
original download were for an earlier version of Pascal. The remainder
does not need compiling - and actually cannot be, as we're missing some
of the objects. But that won't be a problem for using the library.

* In DosBox, run Turbo Pascal, and...
* File, Change directory to `LIBS/DSIK/SRC`
* Options, Open `DSIK.TP`
* File, Open `LOAD.PAS`
* and compile with ALT+F9.
* You now have a suitable version of `LOAD.TPU` in `LIBS/DSIK/TPU`

## Usage

See the original documentation in `DOCS`, and the examples in `SRC`.
