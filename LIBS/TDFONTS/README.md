# TDFONTS

By Tom Doel, July 1995 and September 1996.

This includes the EgaVga driver, and whatever fonts your code needs,
as objects packaged into the EXE, rather than requiring separate BGI or
CHR files to be supplied with the executable.

## Compiling

* In DosBox...
* If you wanted to create the font and graphic objects, then see OBJ/MAKEFONT.BAT
* Run TP, and...
* File, Change directory to LIBS/TDFONTS/SRC
* Options, Open TDFONTS.TP
* If you didn't put TP in C:\TP, then change Options Directories.
* File, Open TDF_1.PAS, and compile with ALT+F9.
* Repeat for TDF_2.PAS and then TDFONTS.PAS
