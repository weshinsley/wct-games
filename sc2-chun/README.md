# Shooting Cheddery II - Shooting Chundery

Wes started this one, but it was boring, and Tom took it and made it a bit
more exciting. It was a birthday present for our friend Andy, who seemed fairly 
happy to play the part of a villian in some of our games. His game-worthy habits 
seemed to include eating jelly teddies and crocodiles and polos, and going 
out for the occasional ten pints of something - surely the makings of a 
madman trying to destroy the earth.

## The Plot

Shoot the vom, with your jelly teddy gun or crocodoile launcher, before it
splutches on the earth, dissolving the ozone layer. The fumes make you 
go drunk and wobbly as the game goes on. And I believe you shoot a giant
polo at the end for some reason.

## The Nonsense (grim)

The world's most alcoholic criminal, Andy, decided recently to steal a quite
nippy space vehicle. It was red. It had the name Escort Estate inscribed on
its bumper. Then Andy drank the alcohol. Space has a nasty effect on drunk
people. He squirmed, wobbled, and fell through the airlock of his newly
acquired toy, and floated aimlessly through the space-time continuum.

Then came the chunder. Gallons of it. Pink, green and red. Splodgy, thick
and gooey. Viscous. Acidic. Capable of dissolving the very planet that the
ANDY came from. Oh dear.

So all you need to do is clear up some chunder. A bit smelly, but oh well,
you can't make an omlette without breaking eggs. If you fail, the world will 
be completely chundered, and the end of the world really will be nigh.

## Running

* `cd sc2-chun`
* `CHED2`

## Compiling

* Compile the [MOUSERMW](../LIBS/MOUSERMW) and [TDFONTS](../LIBS/TDFONTS) libraries.
* Load Pascal, File, Change directory to `sc2-chun\SRC`
* Options, Open `CHUND.TP`
* If Pascal is not in `C:\TP`, change the Unit directories in Options, Directories. And Options, Save.
* File, Open, `CHEDDER2.PAS`
* Alt+F9 (Or Compile menu, Compile)

This will compile the main executable into the `TPU` folder - the colourful
text reader I no longer have source code for. And there's also a `PCX` file 
converted to an executable displayer, possibly made by DeluxePaint.
