# Shooting Cheddery III - Slapping Slappery

The third and final game, written some time in 1995, for Merrick's 17th
birthday probably. Merrick's only mockable attribute apparently, was a
slightly higher than average hair-line, but in a boys-only secondary
school, that is ample ammunition to write a game. Tom wrote this epic
adventure entirely, revised (probably for TDfonts) in June 1996.

## The Quick Plot

Slap everything. As usual, you have a slap, and a mega-slap option. And 
you can also drive left and right to avoid things.

## The Verbose Plot

Legend tells of the Evil Hand-  a dark force (well, sort of
reddish actually) that has, in times past, slapped its way
through civilisation, turning everything or everyone in its
wake to evil and creating anarchy.

Its home is in the desolate Arctic wasteland; there it has
resided since the dawn of time planning its ultimate conquest - the 
destruction of the universe...

...That was until, many years ago, it was buried deep beneath the ice 
and snow after an unfortunate skiing accident. There the Hand resided 
for centuries, its power ebbing, its life force draining...

Until an expedition, sent out to uncover the secrets of the
arctic found the hand, lifeless in its residing place. On that fateful 
day, 25th June 1978, they removed the Evil Hand and transported
it to an archaelogical museum somewhere in the midst of a large city, 
either ignorant or sceptical of the legend. It remained there, forgotten,
still powerless, waiting for a new era...

...That was then, this is now: Now the Hand has regenerated its power; 
17 years to the day it was uncovered, it broke from its storage place 
and set about on its mission again to destroy all justice, turn good
to evil, destroy civilisation with anarchy and force everyone to eat 
Pot Noodles

There is only one man brave enough to stop him - but he is on holiday 
in Spain so Merrick will have to do. The safety of the world now 
resided entirely on Merrick; only he had the slapping power to counter 
the Hand's evil desires and destroy it so that it could never rise again.

Mez courageously decided to hang around for a few months and see what 
would happen. Eventually, after the Hand's  power seemed unstoppable by
any conventional means, Merrick decided to act. He must follow the Evil 
Hand across six areas of the world and, when he catches up with it, 
slap it out of existance.

But beware: Everything and everyone caught in the Hand's wake has turned 
against him; affected by the evil influence they could destroy Merrick
easily if he does not defend himself. 

YOU are Merrick (sorry!) You must guide him through safely, always 
keeping one step behind the Hand, until you will battle it back in its
Arctic Lair: this will be the final showdown; the battle between Good 
and Evil, the War of the Slaps... GOOD LUCK!

## Running

* cd sc3-slap
* slap

## Compiling

* Compile the MOUSERMW and TDFONTS libraries.
* Load Pascal, File, Change directory to sc3-slap\SRC\GAME
* Options, Open SLAP.TP
* If Pascal is not in C:\TP, change the Unit directories in Options, Directories. And Options, Save.
* File, Open, SS_GFX0.PAS and compile with Alt+F9. Close with Alt+F3.
* The same for SS_GFXA.PAS.
* And the same for CHEDDER3.PAS.
* We should have learned how to do makefiles in Pascal, but we didn't.

This will compile the main executable into the TPU folder. There are two
more introductions, which I've got partial source code for, and some spare
fragments of other code that are probably obselete.
