# Shooting Cheddery IV - Shooting Shrubbery

Written by Tom, for Gareth's birthday I think - 1995-1996. A multi-screen
adventure with lots of references to Monty Python, and other TV series at 
the time - and also to Wes's favourite computer...

## The Plot

One day, Cedric the Dwarf was making his way to the annual WCT computer
fair, when he decided to take an alternative route through the woods.
Suddenly, Cedric felt a great pain in his head. He was so surprised he
forgot to call out for help before he fell unconscious.

Four armed knights of the Evil Baron dragged Cedric away, and imprisoned
him in the Baron's castle.

You play Cedric. You must find a way to escape from the Baron's castle, and
make your way home. Fortunately, the Baron himself is away in Madrid for
a Summer holiday, so this is your best opportunity. In addition, due to
a structural breakdown in the space-time continuum in the vicinity of the
castle, various people have appeared temporarily and may be able to help you.

Good luck!
